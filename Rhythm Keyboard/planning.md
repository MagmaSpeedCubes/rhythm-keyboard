Scaling ideas:

Base difficulty: basic 5 keys (F4-C5)
Pro: Add 3 keys (C4-E4)
Max: Add sharp keys in between
Ultra: Double # of keys by adding another octave below

Scoring system

Note scores
{ "Perfect", "Incredible", "Fantastic", "Great", "Good", "Mediocre", "Abysmal" }

Scores
{ 50, 20, 5, 2, 1, 0, -5 }

Tolerances
{ 10, 20, 35, 60, 100, 200, 500 }

Accuracy from 0-100
Accurate is defined as any note that is not "mediocre" or "abysmal"

Combo bonus: +10
Combo is defined as "Perfect", "Incredible", or "Fantastic"

Back-to-back
Back-to-back is defined as any note that is not "mediocre" or "abysmal"

only recognize if within 500ms, otherwise does not count

scored by base score * accuracy^3  * difficulty multiplier 



Perfect score is 1800 * #notes
Scored based on proximity to perfect

Perfect = X+
99% = X
95% = U
90% = SS
80% = S
65% = A
50% = B
30% = C
<30% = D

adjust these values until I average a B or so
